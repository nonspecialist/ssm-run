# ssm-run

A simple (really, quite trivial) `bash` wrapper around the AWS CLI for `aws ssm send-command`.

Allows you to:

* execute one or more commands on one or more instances
* wait for and display the output from all of the commands

and that's all (so far)

## Prerequisites

1. `bash`
1. Make sure you have the SSM agent installed and running on your EC2 instances
   (see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html)
1. Make sure you have AWS credentials available for your command-line

## Installation

Copy `ssm-run` from this repo to somewhere in your `$PATH`. That's it.

Example:
```
# cd to where you downloaded the project
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Usage

```shell
localhost$ ssm-run "<commands>" <instance-id> [<instance-id> ...]
```

Alternatively you can set the instance ID's in a space-seperated environment variable
as well as use single quotes to avoid having to escape most special characters;
```shell
localhost$ export INSTANCE_IDS="abc xyz"
localhost$ ssm-run '<commands>'
```

The command-ID is printed at the start of every run, which means you can use the regular
`aws ssm get-command-invocation` syntax to inspect particular outputs more closely

## Examples

### Getting the disk usage of the root filesystem of two EC2 instances

```shell
localhost$ ssm-run "df -h /" i-00c369e70f5e6dfbd i-4a684e9fdaec52001
Command launched with id 97aa89b4-5afc-4b16-bc74-48c6c47ee3da

### Get the date and Linux kernel details from two instances

```shell
localhost$ ssm-run "date; uname -a" i-00c369e70f5e6dfbd i-08806cf9f5a0a63d6
Command launched with id 46ce90e0-65e2-4d24-9464-547b5f9d0e41

### Execute a command 5 times, with a pause in between

```shell
localhost$ ssm-run 'for n in {1..5}; do df -k /; sleep 5; done' i-00c369e70f5e6dfbd
Command launched with id 0a7bdc66-4878-4bce-9284-7d62258eab59

### Inspecting the output of a command later

```shell
localhost$ ssm-run date i-00c369e70f5e6dfbd
